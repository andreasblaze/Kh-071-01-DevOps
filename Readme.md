## 5) Become familiar with the Linux help system and the man and info commands. Get help on the previously discussed commands, define and describe any two keys for these commands. Give examples. 
Info is the default format for documentation inside the GNU project, man is the much older traditional format for UNIX.

man:
-f option: One may not be able to remember the sections in which a command is present. So this option gives the section in which the given command is present.

## 6) Explore the more and less commands using the help system. View the contents of files .bash* using commands. 
One of the reasons why less was introduced was to allow backward movement line by line. It has a lot of commands that are similar to the vi text editorâ€™s commands, and it supports horizontal scrolling, live monitoring, and more.

more command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying one screen at a time in case the file is large (For example log files). The more command also allows the user do scroll up and down through the page.

# Task1.Part2 
## 1) Examine the tree command. Master the technique of applying a template, for example, display all files that contain a character c, or files that contain a specific sequence of characters. List subdirectories of the root directory up to and including the second nesting level. 

## 2) What command can be used to determine the type of file (for example, text or binary)? Give an example.

## 3) Master the skills of navigating the file system using relative and absolute paths. How can you go back to your home directory from anywhere in the filesystem? 

## 4) Become familiar with the various options for the ls command. Give examples of listing directories using different keys. Explain the information displayed on the terminal using the -l and -a switches.

## 5) Perform the following sequence of operations: - create a subdirectory in the home directory; - in this subdirectory create a file containing information about directories located in the root directory (using I/O redirection operations); 

- view the created file; 
- copy the created file to your home directory using relative and absolute addressing. 
- delete the previously created subdirectory with the file requesting removal; 
- delete the file copied to the home directory. 

## 6) Perform the following sequence of operations: 

- create a subdirectory test in the home directory;
